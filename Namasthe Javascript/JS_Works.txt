Every thing in Javascript happens inside an Execution context.

Execution context is like a big box.

It has two components .
1. Memory component or variable component or Memory creation phase-(all varibales are contained here as key value pair )
2. Code components or thread of execution  or Code execution phase. here, codes are run oneline at a time.

Javascript is a synchronous single threaded language. means it only goes to next line only current line is executed.

--------------------------

When you run a program ,a beautiful execution context is created.

In Memory creation phase, all varibale have stored as undefined and for functions,whole functions are stored as it is.
In code execution phase,all code are executed after memory allocation.
here at first,it stores values for all variables.
But for function invokation, a whole new execution context is created

Call stack maintains the order of execution of execution contexts.

call stack is also known as
1.execution context stack
2.program stack
3.control stack
4.Runtime stack
5.Machine  stack
