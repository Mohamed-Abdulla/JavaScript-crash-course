//Abstraction
//eg: dvd player- in that ,there many complex things hidden inside,but we care abt only play
// button which is  shown to us

//means we hide complex property and methods,and show only necessary prop and method.
//ADV- simple interface - code is clean
//reduce the impact of change- if we change inside,it doesnot have impact on outside
//!Abstraction -reduce complexity ,isolate impact of change
