oops is  the style of programming that centered arrond objects rather than functions.

Four pillars of oops
    Encapsulation
    Abstraction
    Inheritance
    Polymorphism

Before object programming there is procedural programming which based on func.
When there a program is big, there could be a lot of func.which may mess.
This is where oops came in solve the problem.it takess func and varibale and forms like a unit
called object is known  as Encapsulation. we call varibale as property and functions as methods.

ex:car
in car-object
property-make ,model,color
methods-start(),stop(),move()
