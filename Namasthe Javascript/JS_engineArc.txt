Js engine is piece of code which converts our js code in to machine code.it is not hardware  machine.

>What happens inside JavaScipt engine?
>when we write code it goes in to 3 stages.
        PARSING
        COMPILATION
        EXECUTION
    >PARSING
        1.it  first breaks each piece of code in to tokens
        2. then the syntax parser creates AST means Abstract Syntax Tree.then pass this AST to 
    >COMPILATION
        COMPILATION and EXECUTION moves handbyhand
        It has JIT compilation(Interpretter and Compilers )
        when AST came from parsing it moves to Interpretter at the same time Interpretter communicates
        with Compilers and also comiles as much it can .then it  moves to EXECUTION.

    >EXECUTION 
        It recieved code from COMPILATION part.
        It has MemoryHeap and callstack.
           > MemoryHeap is the place where all memory stored and it is constantly sync with a call stack,
            garbabe collector and many more.
           > Call Stack is the place where the final code is run

Interpretter & Compilers
    Interpretter runs code line by line it doesnot know what next line before.
        Adv- code is fast becos it doesnot wait for Compiles.
    Compilers compiles the entire code and created a optimized version of code.then runs.
        Adv- code is efficiency.

Is JS Interpretted or Compiled language?
    it can acts as both depend on JS engine.
    when js is created initially,it was supposed as Interpretted lang .bcoz browsers cant wait for
    compilation.but now it act as both .that acting as Interpretted along with Compiled is known as
    JIT compilation(Just In Time COMPILATION)
